## [Unreleaed] ========================================================================================================
- Support for unique learnsets of all Pokemon




## [0.1.1] - 2023-08-04 ===============================================================================================

## Fixed
- Hellish imports Ã  la Java. No more "from pypokelib.generation1.data.pokemon.basestats.poke_base_class import Pokemon"

## Added
- Not really *added* but started work on moves and movesets. Much more to come

## [0.1.0] - 2023-08-03 ===============================================================================================

### Added
- Fully functional core feature, Pokemon() constructor, callable outside of class module (main.py)
- Installed a "lines of code" counter, which put a .DS_Store file everywhere... Positive side effect:
- Now the entire library structure (empty directories too) is visible on GitHub

## Changed
- Old code was moved to... _OLD_CODE directory... how original

## [0.1.0-beta.3] - 2023-08-03 =======================================================================================

### Added
- Preliminary performance tests (yes, yes, premature optimization == bad, just wanted to take a spin around the block)

## Removed
- Unnecessary helper table (converted int->str to search by str and return str anyway??? huh???)

## [0.1.0-beta.2] - 2023-08-03 =======================================================================================

### Added
- Inits to each directory, effectively making each directory a Python package
- POKEDEX dictionary, allowing for fast lookup times
- Calling Pokemon("Squirtle") and Pokemon(7) now works as intended! Though only in file containing Pokemon base class

## Changed
- Pokemon base class constructor, more robust (methods, data members), uses fast lookup operations
- Renamed certain files, see GitHub repo for more details

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2023-08-02 =======================================================================================

### Added
- Committed to the idea of a single base Pokemon class: much simpler and easier to maintain
- Defined some basic class methods, more to come

## Changed
- Allowed the base Pokemon class constructor to accept either a string containing the species name, or the pokedex id
- That is, Pokemon("Squirtle") and Pokemon(7) should mean the same thing

## Removed
- Abra class, and the idea of having a separate class for each all 151 Pokemon

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2023-08-01 =======================================================================================

### Added
- This version has initial insights of how I want(ed) to call certain methods when completed with pypokelib
- At this point, I was still considering having a class for each of 151 pokemon, but...
- Began work on a Pokemon base class, rather than making a dedicated class for all 151

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2023-08-01 =======================================================================================

### Added
- Created initial repository, threw around initial ideas for library structure
- Wrote functions for calculating stats based on level, nature
- Brainstormed ideas for how to instanstiate pokemon objects, and what data to track
- Fiddled around with datasets

## - Links to previous versions =======================================================================================
